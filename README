Trace context switches and print to the kernel ring buffer.  This
script continuously clears the ring buffer and redirects to
mntrace.txt output file.

The tracer automatically filters and prints context switches between
different cgroups (that are containers in Mininet).  It would be nice
to correlate this information with whatever happens in sch_htb.

You can run sch_htb modified to enable tracing, and mntracer.ko at the
same time:

$ cd htb; rmmod sch_htb; insmod ./sch_htb.ko traced_iface=sw1-eth1
$ cd kmod;
 - Start your mininet experiment, wait for it to initialise
 - ./run.sh
 - Press C-c to stop
